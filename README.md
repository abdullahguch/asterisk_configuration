# Asterisk Configuration

This repo contains the configuration files needed to setup and run an Asterisk VOIP server.

You should at least configure these three files:

- sip.conf
- vocemail.conf
- extensions.conf

You can setup additional features in other files such as:

- manager.conf
- musiconhold.conf
  etc.

Feel free to contribute!!!
